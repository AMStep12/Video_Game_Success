The gaming industry generates billions of dollars in revenue each year. It is often very difficult to stay ahead of the competition when it comes to what will be popular and when. Game developers and publishers have to know if a game will perform well before investing significant resources into its development and marketing. The problem that we want to tackle is to predict the success a video game will have in the market. The "Video Game Sales" dataset, which was found on Kaggle, will be used for modeling purposes. This dataset has games from 1980-2016, including data on the games's name, platform, release year, genre, publisher, and global sales in millions of units. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the success of a video game based on its characteristics. This type of information could help game developers and publishers make informed decisions about which games to invest vast resources into. With proper modeling it can help optimize their marketing and distribution strategies.
